# Phase 3 Roadmap: Agent Ecosystem

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 3 focuses on implementing real agents that can execute the tasks defined in our templates. This moves us from placeholder agents to actual content generation capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture Goals

### Agent Framework
- **Base Agent Class**: Common interface for all agent types
- **Category Agents**: Specialized agents for script, image, audio, video
- **Provider Integration**: Multiple LLM/AI service providers
- **Quality Control**: Validation and quality monitoring
- **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent provider selection and caching

### Agent Types to Implement

#### 1. Script Agents
- **Research Agent**: Web scraping, API integration for data collection
- **Writing Agent**: Content generation with style and tone control
- **SEO Agent**: Keyword optimization and meta tag generation
- **Analysis Agent**: Trend analysis and data interpretation

#### 2. Image Agents  
- **Design Agent**: DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion integration
- **Thumbnail Agent**: YouTube thumbnail generation with text overlay
- **Infographic Agent**: Data visualization and chart generation
- **Social Media Agent**: Platform-specific image formatting

#### 3. Audio Agents
- **TTS Agent**: Text-to-speech with voice selection
- **Music Agent**: Background music generation and selection
- **Audio Editor**: Mixing, effects, and post-processing
- **Podcast Agent**: Long-form audio content creation

#### 4. Video Agents
- **Video Editor**: Automated video compilation and editing
- **Animation Agent**: Motion graphics and transitions
- **Subtitle Agent**: Automatic caption generation
- **Platform Optimizer**: Format optimization for different platforms

## 📋 Implementation Plan

- [ ] Add cost tracking per agent execution

### Phase 3.3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Multi-provider support with automatic failover
- [ ] Agent performance monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Caching system for expensive operations
- [ ] Batch processing for efficiency
- [ ] Advanced quality control and human review queues

### Phase 3.4: Integration & Testing (Week 7-8)
- [ ] End-to-end testing with real content generation
- [ ] Performance optimization and scaling
- [ ] Documentation and examples
- [ ] Production deployment preparation

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Agent Interface
```python
class Agent(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, task: Task, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> AgentResult:
        """Execute a task and return results"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def validate_parameters(self, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Validate task parameters"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def estimate_cost(self, parameters: Dict[str, Any]) -> float:
        """Estimate execution cost"""
        pass
```

### Provider Integration
- **OpenAI**: GPT models, DALL-E, Whisper
- **Anthropic**: Claude models for writing and analysis
- **Stability AI**: Stable Diffusion for image generation
- **ElevenLabs**: High-quality text-to-speech
- **RunwayML**: Video generation and editing
- **Custom APIs**: Social media APIs, web scraping

### Quality Control
- **Output Validation**: Format, size, quality checks
- **Content Moderation**: Safety and appropriateness
- **Performance Metrics**: Speed, cost, quality scores
- **Human Review**: Queue system for manual approval
